# Music Mixer Project

## Project Description

A music mixer site which follows the example of incredibox.com. Allows users to create a drum pattern using basic sounds from a drum set such as the base drum, snare, toms, cymbals in a sequence using 16 slots that repeats itself when the sequence is finished. Afterwards, the User chooses another instrument and creates a 16 spot sequence. These two seqences are played at the same time to create a small song the becomes the sum of both parts. In order to add a selection to the sequence, a drag and drop functionality will be added.
